![The same six prompts in plain Claude Code on the left and with prismantis on the right: a table, a bar chart, a flowchart, LaTeX math, a diff and an incident summary with a warning callout and a checklist](docs/compare.gif)

<sub>Same prompt, same model, left plain Claude Code, right with prismantis. LaTeX needs RaTeX installed and `latex` on.</sub>

## TL;DR

- Claude Code prints mermaid as source and tool calls as walls of text. prismantis draws them: real charts and flowcharts, typeset LaTeX math in kitty and Ghostty, colored tables and code, and quiet tool rows.
- 15 palettes plus `mono`, and copy buttons on everything.
- Two commands to install, `/plugin` to turn it off. Claude Code's own renderer comes back the moment you do.
- No network calls. It runs a program only when you click `⧉ html` (the clipboard helper) or turn on LaTeX (RaTeX's renderer).

```
/plugin marketplace add NahumLitvin/prismantis
```

```
/plugin install prismantis@prismantis
```

Then run `/prismantis demo` for a tour of the main features.

## Install

Requires Claude Code **2.1.287** or later. Run the two commands above.

To update, run this, then `/reload` in every open session. A session keeps the version it loaded until it reloads.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update prismantis && claude plugin update prismantis@prismantis
```

To uninstall:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall prismantis@prismantis
```

For LaTeX math, install RaTeX's renderer and set `latex` to `true`; see [LaTeX math](#latex-math). Until then formulas draw as text.

### Themes

![The same reply in all 15 color themes, ten dark and five light: a tip box, a task list, a flowchart and a bar chart](docs/themes.png)

![Random theme: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis with theme random on the right](docs/compare/random-theme.png)

Dark: `catppuccin-mocha` (default), `dracula`, `nord`, `tokyo-night`, `gruvbox-dark`, `rose-pine`, `everforest`, `github-dark`, `one-dark`, `solarized-dark`.

Light: `catppuccin-latte`, `gruvbox-light`, `rose-pine-dawn`, `github-light`, `solarized-light`.

`mono` drops the palette for bold and dim; alerts keep their colors. Switch with `/prismantis theme nord`, or run `/prismantis` for the help screen with every theme. Every palette is MIT licensed and credited in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

### Tables

![Tables: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/tables.png)

Header cells take the `tableHeader` color, and the default `box` style puts a double line under the header. `tableStyle` picks `box` (the default, every cell boxed), `rules`, `grid` or `minimal`. `:---:` and `---:` alignment is honored, numbers in cells get the number color, and columns shrink to fit the terminal.

### Code

![Code: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/code.png)

![Code fold: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis numbering and folding a 45 line block on the right](docs/compare/code-fold.png)

Each code block gets a header row: the language on the left, a copy button on the right. The code sits indented below with no frame, so selecting it with the mouse copies only the code.

- **Prism** highlights JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX/TSX, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Swift, C, C++, C#, Ruby, JSON, YAML, TOML, SQL, HTML, CSS, Dockerfile, HCL and diff.
- **Shell** blocks (`bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, unlabeled) color the command word, `--flags`, quoted strings and `# comments`, and restart after `|`, `&&` and `;`.

### Diagrams and charts

![Diagrams and charts: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/diagrams.png)

![Diagrams and charts: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/charts.png)

![Diagram too wide: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis falling back to the source with a note on the right](docs/compare/fallback-note.png)

Code blocks tagged `mermaid` draw as colored text art:

- flowcharts (`graph LR`, `graph TD`, decisions), sequence, state, class and ER diagrams
- bar and line charts with `xychart-beta`, sized to the terminal width
- each box and participant gets its own theme color, the same at both ends of a sequence diagram
- bars in a multi-series chart get their own colors; a single-series chart prints each value above its bar and colors the tallest one
- gridlines stay dim, axis numbers use the number color

Diagrams too wide for the window, or over 80 lines, stay as code. `mermaidAscii` swaps box-drawing characters for `+ - |`. Pie charts are not supported.

### Figures

Some things read better as a picture than as a diagram: a timeout racing a retry, the layout of a screen, a system before and after a change. Code blocks tagged `figure` draw line by line as written, in the theme's colors:

````markdown
```figure
{note:          0 s         10 s  12 s            later}
Provider  {accent:●───────────}{warn:✗ timeout}             {accent:●} retry, same event
Handler   {ok:■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■} 200 into the void
Booked    0                 {ok:1}               {warn:2} twice
```
````

- `{role:text}` colors a run: `accent` for frames, lines and arrows (diagram color), `warn` for the break or the risk, `ok` for what is healthy or done, `note` for time and effort (heading color), `dim` for side notes, `strong` for the one thing that matters; the rest takes the diagram text color
- ▶ and ◀ draw as ► and ◄, as in diagrams, so no glyph turns into an emoji; in `mono`, `warn` draws bold
- a figure stays a code block while it streams, when it has more than 80 lines, when a line is wider than the window or than 100 columns, and when it would not draw cleanly: a frame that does not close or whose side slips out of its column, a glyph that may draw as an emoji or takes two columns, a tab, or role markup in the wrong case, misspelled, nested or left open
- `⧉ source` copies the block, `⧉ art` the drawn text
- Claude learns about figures from the [diagram hints](#diagram-hints) note: when a picture helps, the roles, the width and the glyphs that draw cleanly; flows, sequences and charts stay mermaid

### LaTeX math

![LaTeX math: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/latex.png)

Display math, `$$…$$` on lines of its own or a ` ```math ` block, draws as a typeset image in the theme's diagram text color, one formula per line. With copy buttons on, its `⧉ copy` button copies the formula's LaTeX, since selecting an image copies blank cells. It needs [RaTeX](https://github.com/erweixin/RaTeX)'s PNG renderer, a single binary that typesets KaTeX syntax in a few milliseconds without TeX, a browser or Node:

```bash
gh release download -R erweixin/RaTeX -p 'ratex-cli-*-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz'
tar -xzf ratex-cli-*.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
install ratex-cli-*/render ~/.local/bin/ratex-render
```

Pick the archive for your platform (`x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, ...). Any directory on your `PATH` works, but the file must be named `ratex-render`.

LaTeX is off until you set `latex` to `true`. Then prismantis runs `ratex-render` once in kitty and Ghostty, outside tmux, and keeps LaTeX on only if that test formula comes back. If a later run fails, formulas already drawn stay and new ones stay text until you `/reload`. A reply shown before the test finishes draws its formulas as text, then redraws them as images. Anywhere else, without the renderer, or with `latex` off, formulas draw as text in a `math` code block. So does a formula the renderer rejects, or one too wide for the terminal even at one row. While LaTeX is on, the [diagram hints](#diagram-hints) note also tells Claude that `$$` math renders. Inline `$…$` draws as italic text without its dollar signs, with common commands such as `\rho`, `\cdot` and `\le` shown as symbols; amounts like `$5` stay as written.

Formula text matches the reply text. A terminal image fills whole rows, so a formula that falls between two row counts is rendered again with more padding rather than stretched.

### Layout

![Layout: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/layout.png)

When tables, diagrams and figures follow each other, they share a row and wrap once the terminal runs out of width. A wide terminal shows a table, a flowchart and two charts side by side.

### Copy buttons

![Copy buttons: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/copy.png)

- **Tables:** `⧉ md` copies the original Markdown and `⧉ art` a boxed table that pastes well into Slack. `⧉ html` copies a formatted table (headers, alignment, inline formatting) plus a tab-separated plain-text copy.
- **Code, lists and quotes:** `[ ⧉ copy ]` on each. Code copies without its fences, lists as markdown, quotes without their `> ` markers.
- **Diagrams and figures:** `⧉ source` copies the mermaid or figure source, `⧉ art` the drawn art.
- **Whole replies:** replies with more than one block, or any Hebrew or Arabic, end with `⧉ copy reply`, which copies the reply as Claude wrote it. Selecting right-to-left text on screen copies letters in drawn order, not reading order.
- **No mouse:** `/prismantis copy` copies the last reply, `/prismantis copy code` its last code block.

`⧉ html` shows in a local macOS terminal or a Linux graphical session. macOS needs nothing extra. Linux needs [CopyQ](https://copyq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) running (see its [Wayland caveats](https://copyq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/known-issues.html#on-linux-some-features-do-not-work-under-wayland)). On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install -y copyq && copyq --start-server && copyq config autostart true
```

Clicking works where the terminal passes clicks through, as fullscreen mode does. Terminals with copy-on-select, such as Warp, may grab the word "copy" instead.

### Tool rows

![Tool rows: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/tools.png)

![Diff cards: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/diff-cards.png)

Each tool call draws as one line: a verb and its target, `Ran` with a colored shell command, `Read` and `Edited` with the path. A status dot shows done, running or failed, and output still draws below.

Collapsed groups draw one line too: `Ran 3 commands, read 2 files · last: npm test`, with `· N failed` in the flag color when any call failed. Expand a group (ctrl+o or `--verbose`): shell calls keep their colored command with the output boxed below, and other calls use Claude Code's own rows. ctrl+o on a reply shows the original text.

`toolStyle` keeps tool rows apart from what Claude says:

| `chat` (default) | `tree-dim` | `tree-bold` | `classic` |
|---|---|---|---|
| dimmed on the right, capped at 60% of the width | tucked under the sentence with `⎿`, dimmed | `tree-dim` with one-line sentences in bold | bold verb and status dot, full brightness |
| ![chat](docs/tools/chat.png) | ![tree-dim](docs/tools/tree-dim.png) | ![tree-bold](docs/tools/tree-bold.png) | ![classic](docs/tools/classic.png) |

`toolOutput: quiet` shows what Claude did, not what it read: reads, searches and read-only shell commands draw one plain row like `Read src/report.py lines 1–10` and nothing under it. Edits keep their diff and failures show their real error; the full rules are in [docs/tool-output.md](docs/tool-output.md).

![quiet: rows say what was read, nothing drawn under reads](docs/tools/quiet.png)

### Turn footer

![Turn footer: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/footer.png)

The line that closes a turn keeps Claude Code's word and colors the duration: `✻ Baked for 6m 20s`. Terminal only, since that's the only surface that draws it.

### Slash commands

Output from slash commands, built-in or from other plugins, is drawn like a reply, copy buttons included. Errors keep Claude Code's own red line.

### Diagram hints

Claude rarely writes a chart unless it knows the terminal can draw one. With `diagramHints` on (the default), each prompt you type carries a short note that only the model reads. It says tables, alerts, code, mermaid diagrams and `xychart-beta` charts render here, and asks for commands in fenced blocks, since only those get a copy button. A second part describes [figures](#figures): when one helps and when it does not, the role markup, at most 74 columns so a figure fits an 80-column window, and the glyphs one column wide.

The note costs about 190 tokens per prompt, about 290 more for the figure part, and about 60 more while [LaTeX math](#latex-math) is on, when it also says `$$` formulas render. It's off whenever `mermaid` is off, and skipped for headless `claude -p` runs and background notifications.

### Text

![Text: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/text.png)

![Footnotes: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/footnotes.png)

**Bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`, links and bare URLs, clickable as terminal hyperlinks. Numbers, versions (`v2.14.0`), durations (`250ms`, `3h`), sizes (`16Gi`) and percentages (`99.9%`) take the number color, and paths like `~/src/app.ts` the path color.

### Headings, lists, quotes

![Headings, lists, quotes: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/headings.png)

`headingStyle` picks `banner` (the default: a box around H1, a heavy rule under H2), `bold`, `underline` or `uppercase`. Terminals have one font size, so headings stand out through style and color.

Lists keep their numbers and nest with `•` and `◦`. Quotes get an accent bar, and GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`, `[!CAUTION]`) draw as colored boxes.

Task lists draw as `[ ]` and `[✓]`, with done items dimmed and struck through. `taskStyle` switches to `ticks` (`○` `✓`), `box` (`□` `✓`) or `progress`, which adds a done-count bar above each list.

![A task list with done items struck through](docs/task-lists.png)

### Your prompts

![Your prompts: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/prompts.png)

What you type, at the prompt or through Remote Control, draws in the theme's colors. `promptStyle` picks the look, and `off` keeps Claude Code's own. Task notifications and teammate messages are left alone.

| `bubble` (default) | `bar` | `chevron` |
|---|---|---|
| ![a prompt in a rounded box](docs/prompts/bubble.png) | ![a prompt with an accent bar](docs/prompts/bar.png) | ![a prompt with a bold chevron](docs/prompts/chevron.png) |

### Right to left

![Right to left: plain Claude Code on the left, prismantis on the right](docs/compare/rtl.png)

Hebrew and Arabic blocks are right aligned, with bullets, numbers and quote bars on the right and table columns mirrored. Code, numbers, paths and links stay left to right inside them. Terminals treat right-to-left letters differently, so prismantis detects yours and sends the letters the way it needs them. `/prismantis demo-rtl` shows every element, and the `rtl` option forces a terminal's handling or turns it off.

## Configure

Open `/config` and look for the **prismantis** rows, or set values in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "pluginConfigs": {
    "prismantis@prismantis": {
      "options": {
        "theme": "tokyo-night",
        "tableStyle": "grid",
        "headingStyle": "banner",
        "tableHeaderColor": "#ffcc00",
        "numberColor": "cyan"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Options sit under `options`, keyed by the plugin's install name. Project settings are not read for plugin options.

| Option | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `theme` | see [Themes](#themes), or `random` for a new dark color preset each time the mod loads | `catppuccin-mocha` |
| `tableStyle` | `box`, `rules`, `grid`, `minimal` | `box` |
| `taskStyle` | `checks` (`[ ]` `[✓]`, done struck through), `ticks` (`○` `✓`), `box` (`□` `✓`), `progress` (ticks with a done-count bar) | `checks` |
| `promptStyle` | `bubble`, `bar`, `chevron`, `off` | `bubble` |
| `headingStyle` | `banner`, `bold`, `underline`, `uppercase` | `banner` |
| `highlightNumbers` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `highlightPaths` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `toolRows` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `toolStyle` | `chat`, `tree-dim`, `tree-bold`, `classic` | `chat` |
| `toolOutput` | `full`, `quiet` | `full` |
| `copyButtons` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `diagramHints` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `rtl` | `auto`, a terminal (`warp`, `kitty`, `apple-terminal`, `iterm`, `ghostty`, `wezterm`, `vscode`, `alacritty`, `windows-terminal`, `gnome`, `konsole`), `off` | `auto` |
| `mermaid` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `mermaidAscii` | `true`, `false` | `false` |
| `latex` | `true`, `false` | `false` |
| `<token>Color` | any color, see below | theme |

A color is hex (`#a6e3a1`, `#fc0`), `rgb(166,227,161)`, `ansi256(114)` or a name (`green`, `cyanBright`). Values that don't parse are ignored. Every token has a `<token>Color` option and a row in `/config`:

| Token | Colors |
| --- | --- |
| `accent` | reply bullet, H3+ headings, quote bar, running tool dots |
| `heading` | H1 and H2, `note` in figures |
| `strong` | **bold** text, `strong` in figures |
| `emphasis` | *italic* text, variables, attribute names |
| `inlineCode` | `inline code` |
| `codeText` | code block text |
| `codeCommand` | shell commands, functions, class names, keys |
| `codeFlag` | `--flags`, keywords, failures, `warn` in figures |
| `codeString` | strings, `ok` in figures |
| `codeComment` | comments, the code block's language label, `dim` in figures |
| `link` | links, URLs, properties, tags |
| `path` | file paths, regexes |
| `number` | numbers, versions, durations, done dots |
| `quote` | quote text |
| `rule` | rules, chart gridlines |
| `tableHeader` | table header cells |
| `tableRule` | table rules |
| `bullet` | list bullets and numbers |
| `diagram` | diagram lines, `accent` in figures |
| `diagramText` | diagram labels, LaTeX formulas and figure text |

## Troubleshooting

- **A setting or update didn't take:** run `/reload`. A session keeps what it loaded.
- **A diagram shows as code:** its source is over 80 lines or 8,000 characters, it's wider than the window, it doesn't parse, or `mermaid` is off. Widen the terminal or split the diagram.
- **A figure shows as code:** it is still streaming, it has more than 80 lines, a line is wider than the window or than 100 columns, or it would not draw cleanly (see [Figures](#figures)). Widen the terminal, or ask Claude to fix the frame or glyph.
- **No `⧉ html` on tables:** you're over SSH, in the desktop app or VS Code, or on Linux with no graphical session. `⧉ md` and `⧉ art` still work.
- **`⧉ html` copied plain text only:** CopyQ isn't running, or the clipboard helper failed. The toast says why.
- **Clicking a copy button selects the word "copy":** your terminal copies on select. Use `/prismantis copy`.

## Limits

- The parser covers what Claude writes (headings, lists, tables, fences, quotes, emphasis, links). It's not full CommonMark: nested quotes and HTML draw as plain text.
- Widths count CJK and emoji as two columns. Terminals disagree on a few emoji, so those can still be off by one.
- Languages outside the 24 above draw in `codeText`.
- Tested by hand in the macOS terminal; CI runs the tests on macOS, Linux and Windows. The desktop app, VS Code and mobile use the same mod API but are not checked by hand yet.

<details>
<summary>For LLMs and agents</summary>

To change the code, read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) instead.

- **What it is:** a Claude Code mod (function hooks in TypeScript) that redraws assistant replies, slash-command output, tool rows, the turn footer and user prompts. It changes how things look. The one thing it sends the model is the optional diagram hint below.
- **Install:** `/plugin marketplace add NahumLitvin/prismantis`, then `/plugin install prismantis@prismantis`. Needs Claude Code 2.1.287+. Changes apply after `/reload`.
- **Configure:** `/prismantis theme <name>` is the only setter at runtime. Every other option is a key under `pluginConfigs["prismantis@prismantis"].options` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (or a row in `/config`), then `/reload`. Options and defaults are in the [Configure](#configure) table; the machine-readable source is `userConfig` in [.claude-plugin/plugin.json](.claude-plugin/plugin.json). Color values that don't parse are ignored.
- **Side effects:** no network. Programs it runs: the `⧉ html` clipboard helper (`/usr/bin/osascript` on macOS, `copyq` on Linux, 5 second timeout, only on a click), and `ratex-render` while `latex` is on. With `diagramHints` on, it adds about 480 tokens of model-only context to each typed prompt.
- **Turning it off:** `"enabled": false`, or disable the plugin in `/plugin`.
- **For other mods:** `$.prismantis.markdown({ surface, text, columns })`, typed in [types/index.d.ts](types/index.d.ts). See [Other mods](#other-mods).

</details>

## Roadmap

Planned features are on the [roadmap board](https://github.com/users/NahumLitvin/projects/2), one issue each. Give an issue a 👍 to vote for it, or open one for what you miss.

## Develop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NahumLitvin/prismantis
claude --plugin-dir ./prismantis
```

Edits hot-reload in that session. Before a PR run `claude plugin validate .` and `claude plugin test .`, and print [docs/demo.md](docs/demo.md) to check the look. `npm --prefix scripts run bench` times a full render of the demo reply, so speed claims can be checked on any machine. The full rules and verify loop are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Other mods

Other mods can draw markdown in the user's theme with `$.prismantis.markdown`. Pass the surface, the text and the content width in columns.

- It answers the tree to draw, or `undefined` when prismantis is disabled or the text holds nothing to draw.
- It throws when prismantis isn't installed, so call it in a `try`.
- Prismantis draws at least 20 columns wide. Copy buttons are left out, because a button can't cross from one mod to another.

```tsx
let drawn
try {
  drawn = await $.prismantis.markdown({ surface: e.surface, text, columns: e.props.bodyColumns })
} catch {}
return drawn ?? <Markdown text={text} />
```

The types are in [types/index.d.ts](types/index.d.ts). List prismantis under `dependencies` in your `plugin.json` and Claude Code lays them into your `.claude-plugin/types/`. When prismantis is optional, declare the noun in your own contract instead:

```ts
declare module 'claude-code' {
  interface EngineInterface {
    prismantis: {
      markdown: (args: { surface: RenderSurface; text: string; columns: number }) => Promise<RenderElement | undefined>
    }
  }
}
```
